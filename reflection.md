- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance, thankfully, is a concept I already understood from coding in Python. Thankfully, using VSCode and Java instead of Python on Replit REALLY helps with this process and streamlines the entire inheritance system. I'm looking forward to making use of it in the future- I imagine I will be creating superclasses in the same way I like to set up for loops- if I find myself writing the same thing a second time, I make it work numerically, and make it run the same code section again. Works pretty well for shortening a complex program.
